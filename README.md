Creating a new repo that houses my personal GitHub Pages website.
I am a 37 year old male that has been learning Python for the past 2 years. 
I am interested in Automation, Networking and Security, and things relevant in my interest.
I'm a father of 4, have a beautiful wife and family, and hope to use programming to progress my working life.
Currently, I reside in the Philippines and have for the past 16 years.
I've owned a callcenter, and played a part in many complex operations from an operational and technical stand point.
